The device design & production data files will go in here, so that
all the tech materials relating to the production microbit are in one place.

The current device is described in ProductionData, and uses Design Spark PCB
as the editor tool.

Note: The gerber/etc files in here are as provided to the PCB-A
print/assembly house *that we used* and while maybe could be used as-is you
are required to check that they are suitable for your use before you do.
